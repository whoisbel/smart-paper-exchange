        <p>
          To ensure the immutability of certain data, SPEX may utilize
          blockchain technology to store and timestamp certain information.
          Once data is stored on the blockchain, it becomes tamper-resistant,
          providing an additional layer of security and transparency. Users
          acknowledge and agree that specific details, such as transaction
          records and document authenticity, may be recorded on the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that while blockchain provides enhanced
          security, SPEX reserves the right to comply with applicable laws and
          regulations that may require the removal or modification of certain
          information.
